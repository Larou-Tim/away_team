# Away Team! 

##Description
	Away Team is a deck-building style game based on some of our favorite Sci-Fi shows and movies. 

##Motivation
Inspired by some of our favorite card games(Munchkin, FLuxx, Exploding Kittens), we wanted to build an app that we could play online in the same fashion.

##Results
We have a basic, single player app that allows you to play through ten levels of monsters. It enables you to add armor, a ship, a helper, and a weapon. If you die, you have to start all over.

##Team Efforts
 Work was divided mostly into front-end work, javascript coding, and backend.

##Individual Responsibilities
Keli did the heavy lifting on the front end, utilizing materializeCSS styling the web page. Tim was the 
Logic KING, enabling us to have the game that we do in such a short time. Ben and Sam coordinated the database and server-side of the project, making Keli's job much easier from being able to store values for the cards. Ben also came up with most of the humor you see on the cards.

##Challenges
JavaScript Callbacks, Having our tables sync up appropriately while utilizing Sequelize, Keli's procrastination......


##Improvements
 
We would definitely like to make it a multi-player game in order to be able to play with your friends.

Make the front-end more interactive, and style unique cards
